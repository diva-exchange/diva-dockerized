  <summary>Free Banking Technology For Everyone</summary>
  <description>
    <p>You have your own private &amp; secure banking technology.
    A free software and network project based on blockchain and I2P technology.</p>

    <p>The creators behind DIVA.EXCHANGE are convinced that digital values are becoming common means of payment and stores of value.</p>

    <p>The free software project demonstrates how the storage, trade and payment transactions with digital values can be carried out without central service providers â€“ securely and with rigorous privacy protection.</p>

    <p>This brings us one step closer to the vision that every person can be his or her own bank in the future.</p>
